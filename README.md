Finds an optimal path for any agent to get to the nearest goal node using the A* algorithm, and prints the path and expanded nodes. 
Agents are represented by either 'S' representing solar panel meaning no fuel restriction or a number from 0-9 representing how much fuel that agent has remaining. 
G represents a goal node and X represents an obstacle. '+', '|' and '-' are all walls that mark the outside edge of the map. 
An example map can be seen and run from example.py
